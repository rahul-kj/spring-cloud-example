# Sample Spring Cloud Services application

There are 2 modules here: **Producer** and **Consumer**

Create the config-server service and use the repo `https://github.com/rahulkj/spring-cloud-example-config.git` for pulling down the configurations and `master` branch

Producer registers itself with 
- service registry
- config-server

It has just one endpoint, thats the homepage, that return a json with a counter value, that increments on each hit.

Consumer registers itself with 
- service registry
- circuit-breaker
- config-server

The Consumer pull the values from producer and displays the counter value in a better format compared with that generated by the producer. If the producer app dies due to some reason, a default response of `-1` is sent back when the consumer application is accessed.
